# Deep-Learning-course-Final-Project
the final project in a deep learning course, two models (based on yolov5 attempting to detect wheat heads in images). 
the first model is YOLOv5l trained over the kaggle's competition dataset for 16 epochs.
the second model is an ensemble of 3 versions of yolov5 - m,l,x.
